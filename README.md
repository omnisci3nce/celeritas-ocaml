# celeritas-ocaml
OCaml bindings for [celeritas core](https://github.com/omnisci3nce/celeritas-core), a rendering / audiovisual / game engine foundation layer written in C.

## Architecture

There are **two** layers to the bindings:
1. raw bindings generated by ocaml-bindgen
2. a higher-level wrapper around the bindings to make writing idiomatic OCaml code easier

These bindings are generated using [ocaml-bindgen](https://github.com/omnisci3nce/ocaml-bindgen) and in the future will be updated via CI/CD when new versions of celeritas-core are released.
